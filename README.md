# houndforbinders
The Hound of the Baskervilles for the DIY bookbinder. Illustrations by Sidney Paget are from the novel's original serialization in The Strand magazine in 1901-1902. Not all illustrations were included as high-quality scans were not always available. Improved scans are welcome!

Text and illustrations are in the public domain in the United States, with the exception of photographer Peter Castleton's (https://flickr.com/photos/petercastleton/) lovely photograph "Dartmoor Tor", a cropped version of which is used here under a CC-BY-2.0-DEED license.
