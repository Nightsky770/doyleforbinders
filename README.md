# houndforbinders
The Hound of the Baskervilles for the DIY bookbinder. Illustrations by Sidney Paget are from the novel's original serialization in The Strand magazine in 1901-1902. Not all illustrations were included as high-quality scans were not always available. Improved scans are welcome!

Text and illustrations are in the public domain in the United States.

CW: kidnapping and threatened rape, pet death, domestic abuse, animal cruelty, ethnic slur "g---y" (uncensored), 19th-century terms for specific ethnic/cultural groups.

Grateful acknowledgment is made to photographer Peter Castleton (https://flickr.com/photos/petercastleton/) for his lovely photograph "Dartmoor Tor", a cropped version of which is used here under a CC-BY-DEED license.
